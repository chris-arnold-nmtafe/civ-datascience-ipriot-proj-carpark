## Vision

To provide a modern, real-time parking space availability system for the City of Moondalup, helping drivers easily find available parking spots in public parking lots and improving overall parking experience and traffic flow.

## Background

The city is looking to create a proof-of-concept (POC) to digitise their existing parking resources. The project is a low budget project to add sensors to parking lots in order to provide drivers and city administrators with live information about parking availability. The sensors will record information about cars entering and leaving the carpark, as well as temperature information.

## User Stories

### User Story 1

As a driver, I want to know the number of available parking spots in a parking lot so that I can quickly find a spot to park my car.

### User Story 2

As a driver, I want to see the current temperature and time while checking for parking availability so that I can plan my activities accordingly.

### User Story 3

As a parking lot manager, I want to track cars entering and leaving the parking lot in real-time so that I can manage parking resources effectively.

## Technical Backlog Items

1. Develop a Python application to count cars entering and exiting the parking lot (we will be simulating the automatic sensors).
3. Develop a Python application to display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.
4. Ensure proper data handling and error prevention (e.g., no negative parking spots).
5. Read a configuration file in the format of your choice. The number of parking spots should be configurable.

## Definition of Done

1. Cars entering and exiting the parking lot are accurately tracked, and a running total of available spots is maintained.
3. Parking availability, temperature, and time are displayed in a user-friendly format on a suitable display.
4. The system is tested and runs seamlessly. A Raspberry Pi with SenseHat may be used to generate signals instead of the provided user interface.
5. The code is well-documented, object-oriented, and follows best practices.

## Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must count cars entering and exiting the parking lot.
2. The system must maintain a running total of available parking spots.
3. The system must log its activity to a file as events arise.
4. The system must display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.

## Non-Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must be written in Python.
2. The system must use an object-oriented programming approach.
3. The system must display the parking availability updates in real-time.
4. The system must provide a user-friendly interface for drivers.
5. The system must handle edge cases, such as full parking lots and more cars than available spots.
