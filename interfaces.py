    Your carpark management class should "implement" this abstract type (that is, 
    make a new class that inherits from this one, just like this class inherits
    from abc.ABC). When you hit the car in/out buttons or change the temperature,
    Your code should respond accordingly. See an example below!

    This abstract class provides is the display with its data.
    You should implement this class and provide your app's data
    through the properties here.

    Important! note about properties: they are methods but you use them like
    attributes. For example, if I make x a new CarparkDataProvider(),
    I can see the available spaces by referencing x.available_spaces.
    You might usually expect x.available_spaces() to be the way you'd
    access the data, but that won't work!
