*Project Introduction
- Learned about MQTT and sensor simulation.
- Explored the initial codebase from GitHub.

*Initial Development
- Implemented `CarPark` and `Sensor` classes.
- Configured `config.toml` and tested local messaging.

*Troubleshooting & Testing
- Faced issues with Mosquitto broker on Windows.
- Solved connection problems by running via PowerShell.

*Git & Submission
- Created `kanna-local` branch for development.
- Pushed changes and created a pull request.
- Merged to `main` and completed the checklist.

*Reflection
This project helped me understand MQTT communication, Python class structures, and how sensors and carpark logic can work together. I learned to troubleshoot software in a practical way.
